            <h2>History of Wheat</h2>
            <p>The history of wheat from about 10,000 B.C. is an important part of the history of agriculture. Wheat is thought to have first been cultivated in the Fertile Crescent, an area in the Middle East spreading from Jordan, Palestine, and Lebanon to Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Iran</p>
            <p>Over the years farmers continued to make selections from their fields of wheat’s that showed favourable traits – ease of harvest, yield etc. and new wheat’s started to dominate.</p>
