                            Let's not make this. Complicated. I know you.Last night I had the.Strangest dream.That you knew me, too. But you need to wake up.I can't have you disappear. Just like my parents house. I've become, a visitor. In the night you say. That you go underwater. You won't take me, no. You won't drown with your lover. You told me that I wasn't available. I guess I wasn't, I wasn't capable. I want to do better this time. But I guess you're better in the back of my mind. Oh you need to wake up. I can't have you disappear. Just like my parents house. I've become, a visitor. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark. But I'm not, I don't mind. Having a ghost in my bed. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark. But I'm not, I don't mind. Having a ghost in my bed. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark. But I'm not, I don't mind. Having a ghost in my bed. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark. But I'm not, I don't mind. Having a ghost in my bed. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark. But I'm not, I don't mind. Having a ghost in my bed. My mother said I was always afraid of the dark.But I'm not, I don't mind.Having a ghost in my bed
