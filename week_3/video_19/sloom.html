                            The sea said goodbye to the shore so the sun wouldn't notice. The seaweed that wrapped its arms around you. The carpet on my cheek feels like a forest. And I run through the tall trees with your hands chasing me. The books that I keep by my bags are full of your stories. That I drew up from a little dream of mine, a little nightmare of yours. To be asked to take this plunge, to forgive and forget. And be the better man, to be a better man, to be a better man. So love me, mother. And love me, father. And love my sister as well. The cat's silhouette, as big as a monster. In this concrete jungle, with streetlights hanging their heads. So make all your last demands, for I will forsake you. And I'll meet your eyes for the very first time, for the very last. So love me, mother.And love me, father. And love my sister as well. So love me, mother. And love me, father. And love my brother as well. So love me, mother. And love me, father. And love my sister as well. So love me, mother. And love me, father. And love my brother as well. I met a man today and he smiled back at me. Now there are thoughts like these that keep me on my feet. That keep me on my feet
